                                        To deconstruct is to dismantle, break apart, or reduce something to its constituent parts in order to reinterpret it. Through the process of deconstruction, you can expose hidden internal assumptions and contradictions, uncover and unconceal embedded mechanisms, and bring out into the open what has previously been left to the imagination.<br><br>
                                            But, deconstruction can be isolating, harsh, and debilitating. When an idea, concept, or thing is deconstructed, its fragments can be left broken or can be pieced together. The deconstructed parts of a whole are open to reinterpretation.<br><br>
                                            To reconstruct is to form an impression, model, or reenactment of a past event or thing from the available parts or evidence. The process of reconstruction involves building, forming, or reorganizing something again after it has been broken down.<br><br>
                                            Our lives are embedded in “constructions.” In this project, I was tasked with picking one to deconstruct (dismantle, break apart, or reduce to its constituent parts) and reconstruct (build back, reform, or reorganize).</p>

                                        <p class="fw-light mb-0 py-3">Saladify is an application designed for salad lovers who enjoy exploring new recipes that support their healthy, balanced lifestyle. But, these users also prioritize variety, convenience, and flexibility in their exploratory cooking habits. </p>
                                        <h2 class="h5 fw-bold py-3">1. Variety </h2>
                                        <p class="fw-light mb-1">To support our target user group, users can browse from a variety of salad recipe options on Saladify. Users can also conveniently filter their recipe options based on their health goals and dietary restrictions. For instance, users can find recipes that fit their calorie, sugar, sodium, and protein intake goals as well as any diet(s) they choose to follow. </p>
                                        <h2 class="h5 fw-bold py-3">2. Convenience </h2>
                                        <p class="fw-light mb-1">Once the user selects a recipe to explore, Saladify breaks down each recipe’s ingredients list to support the user’s food preparation and grocery shopping experiences. Specifically with Saladify, users can specify which ingredients that they have at home and which ingredients they need to buy at the store. In our future iterations, to simplify the grocery shopping experience further, we plan to supply users with information on the stock of each ingredient at their selected grocery store.</p>
                                        <h2 class="h5 fw-bold py-3">3. Flexibility</h2>
                                        <p class="fw-light mb-3">Saladify also provides users with the freedom to change their mind at any point in their recipe preparation process. With Saladify, users are able to replace ingredients in a recipe’s ingredients list — in the case that the grocery store does not have an ingredient in stock or for any other reason. Saladify’s API will suggest replacements for ingredients. Next, users can select the alternative ingredient of their choice. Then, Saladify will reconstruct their selected recipe accordingly.</p>
                                        <p class="fw-light mb-3">Users can also change their mind about their selected recipe at any point in their preparation process. While shopping for a recipe, users can easily and quickly find a similar recipe. Saladify will use the ingredients the user already has to find and reconstruct a list of similar recipes.</p>
                                        <p class="fw-light mb-3">Overall, Saladify supports its users’ fondness for exploring new recipes while maintaining a healthy lifestyle by:</p>
                                        <h2 class="h6 mb-1">- Supplying various salad recipe options that fit users’ personal goals.</p>
                                        <h2 class="h6 mb-1">- Designing a more convenient and simplified grocery shopping experience.</p>
                                        <h2 class="h6 mb-1">- And, providing users the flexibility to deconstruct a selected recipe or reconstruct a similar recipe. </p>

Many adults, whether in college or working, are often unable to spend time planning meals and recipes due to hectic schedules. We wanted to create a recipe app that would let users easily track the ingredients they needed and already had for recipes, locate stores that have those ingredients in stock, and swap ingredients with smart recommendations - all in an effort to increase convenience and flexibility. Moreover, we wanted to allow adults who desired healthy recipes either for themselves or their children to have the option to choose recipes according to their health preferences. Thus, we implemented a thorough filtering feature based on several health goals and dietary restrictions. Lastly, as salad lovers, we decided to focus our target users on those who love salads too! And thus, Saladify was born!</p>

                                        <br>3. During their weekly grocery trip, interviewees often can’t find all recipe ingredients at a local store. So, they have to go to another grocery store again for the other ingredients to complete a recipe.

                                    <p class="fw-light mb-2">After finding out the perspective of interviewees, we decided to include the nutritional value in our app to show details of information such as calories, sugar, protein, and sodium in our filter interface page. Using API, we included an interface which suggests alternate ingredients using a swap button.</p>
                                    <h2 class="h6 mb-1">2. Ability to Swap Ingredients</h2>
                                    <p class="fw-light mb-2">Moreover, we implemented swap features such that the swap ingredients do not compromise the flavor of the dish. To avoid multiple trips to the grocery store and save user's time, we developed the idea of allowing users to select a grocery store that has a specific ingredient in stock in the ‘Shop for Ingredients’ page.</p>

                                    <p class="fw-light mb-0">Sarah is a 30 year old woman who enjoys trying healthy recipes for her and her 3 year old daughter. She has no dietary restrictions, but prioritizes buying organic ingredients and avoids processed food. She doesn’t mind food that is high in calories, but is careful of consuming food that is too salty or sugary. Sarah experiments with new recipes several times a month. She uses a cookbook or Google to find recipes. Her refrigerator contains a variety of vegetables like mixed greens, spinach, carrots, and other useful ingredients for salads like cheese, avocado, berries, and yogurt. She also has raw honey, balsamic vinegar, avocado oil, and organic olive oil. Sarah does a large grocery trip about once a week. Her local grocery store is small and sometimes she is unable to find everything she needs, especially if it’s organic or a specific brand. On her large trips, she’ll go to Whole Foods. She can usually find the ingredients she needs there, but won’t always have everything she needs when she decides to try a new recipe.</p>

                                    <div class="col-7 mb-5 h-100">
                                        <p class="fw-light mb-0">Sarah wants to try a healthy recipe for lunch. She goes onto the Saladify app and browses a list of salads. She is intrigued by a recipe for Salmon Avocado Salad with a lemon vinaigrette dressing, so she clicks the salad to see more information. The app lists that the required ingredients are salmon, baby spinach, tomatoes, avocado, cucumber, red onion, lemons, olive oil, dijon mustard, honey, garlic, and salt and pepper. Sarah marks the ingredients she already has, which are salt and pepper and spinach. She then goes to her local grocery store. Unfortunately, the salmon fillets are out of stock, however she is able to find the remaining ingredients and marks those ingredients too. Sarah clicks the swap button next to the salmon fillet. The app suggests replacing salmon fillet with smoked salmon as a substitute ingredient. Sarah is able to find the smoked salmon and marks that as well. Interested to see what additional salads she can build from the ingredients she now has, Sarah clicks the “Make Similar” button. The app shows a new list of makeable salads and of those is a Smoked Salmon, Avocado, and Arugula Salad with Champagne vinaigrette dressing. Sarah sees that the additional ingredients required to make this salad are pear, arugula, shallots, and champagne vinegar. Knowing she already has arugula and shallots at home, she finds pears and champagne vinegar at the store and adds them to her shopping cart. Thirty minutes later, Sarah is back at home and using the instructions on the app to make the delicious Smoked Salmon, Avocado, and Arugula Salad!</p>

                                    <p class="fw-light mb-3">It was very interesting and exciting to see how our users were reacting to our design prototype. We got some valuable user experience and feedback. Our users felt that our application was very intuitive, simple to use, and easy to navigate. The colors were consistent and matched the theme of our application. An important idea that our users suggested was to include instructions in the View Recipe screen somewhere to allow the user to decide whether they would like to invest the time to make that recipe.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2 class="h5 fw-bolder mt-3 mb-3">What parts of the interface worked well and allowed the user to achieve their goals?</h2>
                                    <p class="fw-light mb-3">The checklist of ingredients and swapping of ingredients for alternatives worked extremely well. The buttons are very user friendly and allow users to keep track of what ingredients they currently had and what ingredients they wanted to swap for alternatives. Some of the users stated they couldn’t always find all the ingredients needed for complicated salads in their normal lives, but our features addressed this issue by allowing them to easily track the ingredients with customization. Overall, users were satisfied interacting with features.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2 class="h5 fw-bolder mt-3 mb-3">Did the user say or do anything surprising or unexpected? (If so, what?) Did they use the prototype in a different way than intended?</h2>
                                    <p class="fw-light mb-3">Users mentioned a good point that having instructions near the beginning of the recipe process is extremely helpful in helping users decide which salad they would like to make. Users used the buttons and features the same way as we were expecting them to.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2 class="h5 fw-bolder mt-3 mb-3">Did the user request any features or functionality that we had not previously thought of?</h2>
                                    <p class="fw-light mb-3">Users requested having instructions on the View Recipe screen. They also requested changing the color of the text on the Browse Salads and Similar Salads screen to make some things easier to read.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2 class="h5 fw-bolder mt-3 mb-3">How will our learnings help inform the next iteration of the prototype?</h2>
                                    <p class="fw-light mb-3">I can apply the insights from our user evaluations by improving the app's navigation process. This will help users save time and make better decisions. I can add a section in the View Ingredients page to see the instructions and change the color of the text on the Browse Salads/Similar Salads screens.</p>
